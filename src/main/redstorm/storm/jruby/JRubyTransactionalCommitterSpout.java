 * the bolts to the workers. JRuby does not yet support serialization from Java
 * (Java serialization call on a JRuby class). 
 *
 * Note that the JRuby bolt proxy class is instanciated in the prepare method which is called after 
 * deserialization at the worker and in the declareOutputFields method which is called once before 
 * serialization at topology creation.
